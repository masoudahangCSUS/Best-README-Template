## Project Synopsis
The Callejo Inc. Childcare Website is a senior project developed by Tech Squad, a group of Computer Science students at California State University, Sacramento. Spanning from Fall 2024 to Spring 2025, this project aims to support Jane Callejoâ€™s family-owned childcare business by creating an intuitive and efficient website.

The purpose of this website is to simplify the essential operations of the childcare center, such as managing child rosters, scheduling employees, and tracking business expenses. These tasks, currently done manually, are time-consuming and prone to errors. By centralizing these processes into a single platform, the website will save time, reduce mistakes, and improve the overall efficiency of the business.

Additionally, the website will enhance communication with parents by providing timely updates and notifications, fostering trust and transparency. With streamlined workflows and clear channels for parent-provider interaction, the project aims to create a reliable and organized system that benefits both the childcare staff and the families they serve.
